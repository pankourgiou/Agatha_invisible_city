print("Agatha is the invisible city of isolation and loneliness from a point of view. People like going for tourism in Agatha because the can find peace and quiet.Agatha used to be considered a holy place by it's inhabitants. They originally believed that a sign in the air was God's sign to built their city in an isolated fashion on the desert.After this sign and after building the city in total isolation, Agatha s citizens took an oath of silence that till now has not been broken. What was this sign on the air though maybe we will never know,what are those secrets people in Agatha city keep?? Tourists tend to talk on Agatha as if it is a place of hidden treasures and gold...Citizens of Agatha city are very friendly with tourists even if not much talkative. One person that visits Agatha might start wondering is all this secrecy rational??But for Agatha s citizens everything happens for a reason even the lack of it has a deeper meaning. Suddenly everything in the city, every corner and blind spot challenges truth by giving it a deeper meaning and perspective. Why do we consider connectivity as the only way to heaven? People who visit Agatha city however are not common people. From a point of view we can say people who visit Agatha city are decoders of truth and deeper meanings...their visit to Agatha is a pilgrimage to the unknown, a pilgrimage to a God that we might not always be able to perceive but who he progresses inside people hearts and minds to something new. Agatha is a place to be after all, a place where dream and imagination mingle so that they enhance imagination to new highs and levels.")
